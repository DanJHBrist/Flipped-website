# Flipped-website

This is the HTML & CSS that I built for an author's website, befor ethey chose to have it built on weebly, which is also my work.

The folder named "Site Photos" has 2 sub folders: 
- the one called "Coded pages" has the site as it is coded (not entirely finished as the decision to host it on weebly was made halfway through the design process)
- the one called Weebly has the images of the site as it is on Weebly and can be found at : https://flippedbythawthorne.weebly.com/

An example of the code front/landing pages:

And the Weebly landing page:

More screenshots can be found in the folder named "Site Photos".
