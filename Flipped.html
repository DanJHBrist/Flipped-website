            <h3>About the book</h3>
            <p>
            In this novel about being seen and what is not seen, the previously hidden is revealed when the 
            unexpected happens. In the unusually wet winter of 2010, two teenage girls set off to a party on a farm 
            across a river, and disappear without a trace. Six years later, in the worst drought in living memory, 
            a young woman vanishes while on her way home from work on a busy road. In the days following these events, 
            those closest to the missing women are forced to question how well they really know them.
